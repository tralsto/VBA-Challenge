Repo for Module 2: VBA Challenge
This repository will include all of my work regarding the Module 2 VBA Challenge as posted in BCS/GitLab.

In this assignment, we had to analyze stock market data over multiple years and combine like data and from there determine certain calculated values.

What will be included is the Excel files: alphabetical testing and multiple year stock data; 3 separate Visual Basic Script files (ticker and total stock volume, yearly change and percent change, and the calculated values); and 3 screenshots showing each of the three sheets of the multiple year stock data workbook with the results of my code.
    
Thank you!
