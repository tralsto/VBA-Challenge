# VBA-Challenge

Repo for Module 2: VBA Challenge
This repository will include all of my work regarding the Module 2 VBA Challenge as posted in BCS/GitLab.

This will include: 
    Excel files (alphabetical testing and multiple year stock data)
    3 separate Visual Basic Script files (ticker and total stock volume, yearly change, and percent change)
    3 screenshots showing each sheet of the multiple year stock data workbook with the results of my code
    
Thank you!
